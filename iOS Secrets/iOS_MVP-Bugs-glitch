Check the latest github main i did it via mobile and we are on 1.0(6) version right now. The app is still very buggy, glitchy and unusable. I am now with the latest version. See my observations below [ make sure you follow the skills and act according to that ]
1. Was able to fix the refresh trigger issue
2. The placement of the app is not looking right/good. [ the top of the app i.e. the 10 mile radius animation radar is way up top does not give a good feel the app should be lower ]
3. The current local vibe( the top most what's happening vibe card) takes atleast 10 mins for the update to happen
4. Traffic, Events cards show nothing/empty. After 10 mins or so show N/A. Events 0.  
5. The hyperlocal brief cards all are broken at this point. Tab on any of the cards still don't show the tab it does however the user cannot find any difference( they stay where they are )
      1. Pulses - show error loading. 
      2. traffic  - Stuck at checking roads 
      3. Events Unable to load 
      4. Gas and more card - looks as is no error message etc. atleast. 
6. None of the Local events load. i am getting a `Request timed out`. After almost 12 mins
7. No luck with Farmers market. shows ` No Farmers Maekts found in the USDA dB for this area` when we see multiple entries in desktop. 
8.Traffic tab shows errors. 

Check screenshots for all. We are noteven hitting MVPs here. If you think you
